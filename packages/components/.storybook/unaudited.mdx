# Unaudited Components

These components are not yet audited, and thus not necessarily recommended for further use. 

After an audit, a component may either be moved to Calypso Components, deprecated, or classified as safe to use. If there is a similar component in [WordPress Core](https://wordpress.github.io/gutenberg), you should probably use that instead.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the `#design-systems` channel on A8C Slack or ping Team Calypso.
