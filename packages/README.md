# Packages

This directory exists to hold a variety of projects and libraries that we might publish as [NPM packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-packages-and-modules). Typically used also elsewhere in Calypso and build on `yarn start`.

For projects that can produce independent, binary-like outputs deployed elsewhere, see [`/apps`](../apps).

## Adding a new package?

If you want to add a new project or package into this directory, Check the guidelines in the [monorepo documentation](../docs/guide/monorepo.md).
