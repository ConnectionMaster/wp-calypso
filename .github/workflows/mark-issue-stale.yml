            <p>This PR has been marked as stale. This happened because:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>It has been inactive for the past 3 months.</li>
              <li>It hasn't been labeled `[Pri] BLOCKER`, `[Pri] High`, `[Status] Keep Open`, etc.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If this PR is still useful, please do a trunk merge or rebase
            and otherwise make sure it's up to date and has clear testing instructions.
            You may also want to ping possible reviewers in case they've forgotten about it.
            Please close this PR if you think it's not valid anymore â€” if you
            do, please add a brief explanation.</p>

            <p>If the PR is not updated (or at least commented on) in another month, it will be automatically closed.</p>
          close-pr-message: |
            <p>This PR has been automatically closed as it has not been updated in some time.
            If you want to resume work on the PR, feel free to restore the branch and reopen the PR.</p>
